## Project Aim

The aim of this project was to examine various Deep Learning models to identify the model that is most optimized for handling the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet classification challenge. The goal was to develop a reliable and efficient tool for ASL alphabet recognition, which can bridge the communication gap between individuals with hearing impairments and those who do not know sign language.
